## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) server running locally or remotely

### 🔧 1. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` root and configure your database and JWT secrets (e.g., `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `JWT_SECRET`).
4. (Optional) Run database seeders if you want dummy data to test UI components out of the box:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node seed.ts
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```
   *The API will typically be exposed at `http://localhost:3000`.*

### 🎨 2. Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Angular development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   *The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Access it at `http://localhost:4200`.*

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend tests
```bash
cd backend
npm run test         # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e     # End-to-end tests
npm run test:cov     # Coverage report
```

### Frontend tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test         # Unit testing with Vitest
```
